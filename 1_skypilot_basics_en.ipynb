    "# Part 1: SkyPilot Basics\n",
    "Welcome to this tutorial! I am Daniel, a member from the SkyPilot team. I am super excited to give you guys a basic tutorial to use SkyPilot. This is a casual tutorial, so relax and feel free to follow along.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, I would like to give you some links:\n",
    "- [Documentation](https://docs.skypilot.co/en/latest/overview.html)\n",
    "- [Slack](https://slack.skypilot.co/)\n",

    "## So What is SkyPilot?\n",
    "Are you sick of waiting for GPU quotas? Did your compliance team just tell you that you should use Azure due to regulations in Europe, but your infra is in AWS? Are you worried that you are stuck in `us-east-1`? Oh wait, now you need TPUs? Did your company CFO pass out after looking at your cloud usage bills? Then SkyPilot might be the solution for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "SkyPilot makes running your AI workloads easy on any cloud or infrastructure. It provides a *unified compute interface* that **abstracts** away the underlying cloud/infra, allowing your AI teams to focus on experimenting instead of chasing GPUs.\n",

    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "What SkyPilot gives you is a unified interface of *clusters*, *jobs*, and *services* that works across **any cloud**!! The documentation has a great introduction for all the concepts. Here, we are going to go over setting up SkyPilot and just some of its core features.\n",
